Condemned Escape Room Program Guide

The main screen when opening is a text box and above is the background black box photo.

Type in a code you believe will work during the event. Once code is typed in, that is a max of 8 characters, hit enter. If typing in one of the 5 correct codes, it will render that valve's reading. However, if the wrong code is typed in, it will render the incorrect image.

Regardless of if code is correct or incorrect, after 3 seconds the image will reset to the blank black background.



The code is set to refresh the browser automatically after the image disappears after 3 seconds, so no refresh is needed.
